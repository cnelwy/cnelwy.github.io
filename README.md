## UniLoo: The Ultimate Guide to Accessible Harvard Bathrooms - cnelwy.github.io
This project aims to recommend a bathroom to a student user in Harvard Yard based on various accessibility factors, such as the presence of an automatic door button or a larger stall, as well as elevator access. Disabled people face many challenges each day that could be avoided with proper accommodations and advocacy. Growing up with my brother, who has Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome, a rare neuromuscular disorder, I have witnessed these obstacles firsthand. I hope to bring awareness to needed accessible restroom features that many people may typically overlook, while creating a tool that can make a positive impact at Harvard.

This project is intended for use in Harvard Yard, and the user is assumed to have a valid HUID in order to access the recommended bathrooms. First, the user fills out the survey on the homepage, and then is met with a pop up recommendation directing them to a bathroom suitable for their needs, based on their responses to the survey. Important to note that a separate window does not appearâ€“-the recommendation comes from a pop-up event that occurs once the user hits the submit button.

I would like to add that while I believe the goal of this project has merit, the implementation definitely fell short of my expectations. Due to outside circumstances (I have been quite sick this semester), I was not able to dedicate the amount of time I would have liked to this project. With more time and more expertise, I could imagine adding features that allow users to input information about Harvard bathrooms (ie crowdsourcing) that would expand the project to all buildings without me having to manually find and structure the data like I did with this project. I also would have preferred to create a database .db file that stores the user responses and then access them with SQL, but I faced quite a few technical difficulties implementing that on my local Visual Studio Code and pushing to GitHub so that my website got the changes.
